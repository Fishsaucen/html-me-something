            <p><b>Layout: </b>Standard US ANSI. This layout is the standard for most keyboards produced today. While I find it generally acceptable to type with it has a few
            problems which I'd like to address:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Caps Lock location:</b> I honestly can't imagine why this key is placed where it is. It's in prime real estate for a something that is seldomly used in
                my experience.
              </li>
              <li><b>Escape key location:</b> This boils down to my text editor of choice, VIM. For most people it's location isn't a issue but if you're familiar with VIM and
                  it's normal/insert mode you'll see why this is a problem. When typing in VIM the user is constantly changing between normal/insert mode and the default key
                  to exit insert mode is Escape which is a pain with this layout.
              </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><b>Switches: </b>Cherry MX Brown. These switches are in the light range for mechanical keyboards(45cN) and are in my opinion decent for typists. They're light
                  enough that you can type for extended periods of time without experiencing fatigue while also providing more resistance than traditional rubber dome keyboards
                  which I find makes the typist more cognizant of each stroke thus preventing accidental double taps.
            </p>
            <p><b>Feedback: </b>About halfway through the key travel the user will notice a slight bump which indicates that a key has been pressed. This feature is great as 
                  it allows the user to avoid fully depressing the key.
            </p>
            <p><b>Other notable features: </b>Comes with a function key which allows the use of media keys and a special key to toggle whether or not the Meta key(Win/Command)
                  can be used.
            </p>

            <p><b>Layout: </b>ANSI "Unix". Very similar to the ANSI US layout with some notable changes. The Caps Lock key is exchanged with the left control key(a feature which I love),
                  the backspace key is located where the \ key is normally located and in its place are the \ and ~. The Escape key populates the traditional position of the ~ character
                  which makes typing in VIM a much more pleasurable experience.  Last but not least this keyboard comes with a compose key which allows typing special characters such 
                  as &reg;, &pound;, or &para; with relative ease.
            </p>
            <p><b>Switches: </b>Rubber dome. I'm personally not a fan of rubber dome switches but most users won't mind.</p>
            <p><b>Feedback: </b>Virtually no feedback is given until the key is fully depressed. Again, I'm not personally a fan of these but most users shouldn't mind.</p>
            <p><b>Other notable features: </b>Features two columns of five keys which can be assigned using a utility such as AutoHotKey.</p>

            <p><b>Layout: </b>ANSI "Unix". Similar layout to the Sun Type 6 with a few notable exceptions. The most apparent difference in this keyboard's layout is the arrow key 
                  cluster at the bottom right of the keyboard left under the Enter key. The key cluster which usually contains Home, End, Del, etc. on full sized keyboards has also
                  been merged with the main keys; consequently, keys such as shift, Enter and backspace have a reduced size.
            </p>
            <p><b>Switches: </b>Cherry MX Black. These switches fall into the heavy range for mechanical keyboards(60cN). Due to the increased force required for a key press these
                  switches may result in fatigue. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Feedback: </b>Unlike the Cherry MX Brown switches these do not provide a tactile bump anywhere during a key press.</p>
            <p><b>Other notable features: </b>Features stepped keys(tab, ctrl, caps, enter, backspace, shift) which can help typists avoid accidently pressing those those keys.
                  More importantly the interface is a din-10 plug which seems to only be supported by certain Wyse terminals. Luckily users at <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=52597.0">
                  geekhack</a> have created custom firmware using the Atmega32U4 microcontroller which allows the use of this keyboard on modern PCs after some simple modifications are made.

            <p><b>Layout: </b>ANSI "Unix" 60&percnt;. Reminiscent of the Sun Type 6 except it lacks dedicated arrow keys, the numpad, and dedicated function keys. Great for those looking
                  for a Unix style keyboard with little desk space to spare. The lack of the aforementioned keys are made up for by providing them with a function overlay. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Switches: </b>Topre(45cN). Users describe these switches as somewhat of a "refined rubber dome" with traits similar to mechanical switches.</p>
            <p><b>Feedback: </b>Provides a tactile bump near the top of the key before the key is activated. This can make it somewhat difficult for unaccustomed users to avoid bottoming
                  out.
            </p>
